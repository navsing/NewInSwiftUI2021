Exploring SwiftUI 2021 Documentation

Every WWDC, Apple introduces brand new features to SwiftUI. As I read through the documentation here - https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui, I figured I'll make quick snippets and commit every week to this repository. Please feel free to fork.

1. 09/15/2021 - Async Image
2. 09/22/2021 - Badges in Tab bar and List
3. 09/29/2021 - Swipe Actions on List Item
